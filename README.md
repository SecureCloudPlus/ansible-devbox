# Using VScode DevContainers for a clean dev env
This is a starting point to allow ansible dev work, using Windows, VSCode and Rancher Desktop as the dev env. Saves havign a seperate linux box to run ansible from, making a portable env for our windows desktop world.

##TODO
- [ ] Add VMware tools
- [ ] pre-populate ansible collections
- [ ] offline/IMPEX ready

## How it works

The Nutanix Dev Station doesn't ship a container image, instead it builds a local image in your computer based on the settings in the `devcontainer.json` file included in the `.devcontainer` directory. It uses the Microsoft Visual Studio Code Dev Containers extension, and we just provide a standard configuration file with several tools enabled. You can customize it adding, updating, or removing tools.

When opening a project in VS Code that includes the `.devcontainer` directory, the Dev Container extension prompts the option for building the container. Then the project folder is mounted inside the container. The content of the project folder is always available regardless of opening it locally or in the container.

Additionally, two container volumes are used for persisting Calm DSL cache and bash history after rebuilding the container when making changes to `devcontainer.json`.

## How to use

You only need the `.devcontainer` directory in the project root folder:

1. Clone or download the repository.

1. Copy or move the `.devcontainer` directory to your project.

1. To enable/disable or configure different tool versions, edit the `devcontainer.json` file in the `.devcontainer` directory.
